# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
We will be Performing analysis on Kickstarter funding campaigns to uncover trends in relation to launch dates and funding goals. There have been plenty of successful crowdfunding projects; we want to provide evidence of why the kickstarter was successful or unsuccessful. We will dive into the data of what can help generate a successful outcome. Will define the Outcome by visualization such as tables and graphs. 
### Purpose
This report will provide insights about these Kickstarter campaigns by Outcomes based on launch date and fundraising goals.The outcome of these results will provided you with data to have a succesful Crowdfunding Campaign. You will be able to use these insights to start crowdfunding for your play; "Fever".
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In the chart below you will see Outcomes based on Launch Date. Outcomes were very successful in May and June. Better to Launch your project in those months. There is a higher rate of failure if you decide to launch in October or the 4th quarter of the year. Created a pivot table based on successful, failed, and cancelled theater plays. We analyzed based off launch date; we used the month in this case to showcase. The pivot table helped create the chart to show the outcome more visually.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This chart will show what Outcomes via Goals. In the figure below you can see if you goal was less the $1000 you were more successful at getting funded. There were no cancelled projects. They were unsuccessful at meeting goal if kickstarter goal was between $1000 to $4999. We transition the successful, failed and cancelled plays to percentages. Need to get the total number of each category and see how many failed and how many were successful. The use a line chart to show a better visual to understand how each category performed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Faced challenges with Statistics and plugging in correct formula to find percentages in the Outcomes Based on Goals chart. Understanding the concept of how to use the countifs function and make sure it was put into percentages correctly.  Had to ensure the syntax of the Countif function was correct. Placed less than amount in wrong place without criteria which caused me to fill the chart with zeros. I spot check the info and realized it was incorrect. I corrected the syntax to get the correct answer.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1.Highest Successful Outcomes of theater plays were in the month of May.
  2.Over 493 failed. Highest failed month is October.  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  Kickstarting funding goals between $1000 to $4999 where 14.65% successful with 626 projects. There were also more failed project with a goal of less    than $1000. You have a higher chance of a successful goal if between $1000 to $4999. No projects failed that was $5000 or greater. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  Data is based on the years 2009-2017
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  Based off the entire kickstarter worksheet we could create the following tables and graphs below: 
  - Bar chart
  - Line Chart
  - Box and whiskers plot chart
